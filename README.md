Demonstrates the use of error handling and event handling with the basics of C#.

The most difficult acpect of this excersie was when I was trying to subtract two DateTime values to make sure 
the days selected for vacation are valid. I was able to do this using a TImeSpan property called TotalDays.

I used enums again. Interesting but I'm not 100% sure on the application of it yet.
